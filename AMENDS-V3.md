Hero section:

Hero title make "Curated by Insiders" smaller.
CTA button at the bottom of hero: check thats its "Aventa"
Update copy: Enter the experience[s] <-- add S

MAP:

Make sure "Where will LIV take you" is on one line
Need a 'all on' and 'all off' toggle for the map
Multiple select for the map
Seasons: All 4 seasons black/grey or white if you activate / deactivate
For all the filter buttons use same active state 

Experiences:

All panel content should align top.
Update CTA text to "Design my journey"
“Read more” shall be more visible.

Corporate & Incentives:

Change title Creative Incentives => Incentives & Activities
Symmetric: wellness & biohacking not on the same level 
Optimize performance: only one line
CTA button = Chat with LIV opens up, same as for Experiences, not jumping down to contact sheet. The CTA button in the read more pop up works well, jumps to LIV. 

Featured Storytellers:

Remember that you must add “Design with LIV” to each storyteller info box.
SEE ALL is not visible, make the rounded CTV button

LIV Flow needed (maybe needs a seperate instructions file for LIV for this)

LIV: Meet Extraordinary Storytellers (Live Chat Version)
LIV: Welcome. I help you discover and meet extraordinary storytellers — creative minds who shape the Swedish creative industry and culture scene.
What kind of storytellers have you always wanted to meet or learn more about — those in film, music, performance, fashion, design, visual art, writing, photography, digital media, technology, or wellness?

Guest selects a topic

LIV: Beautiful choice. I can suggest a few storytellers who truly bring that world to life.Would you like to connect through a meet & greet, workshop, or creative activity?

LIV (searching online and list 5 different persons according to the topic):I think you’ll love these — five storytellers whose work carries the spirit you’re looking for.
Which one feels right to you, or shall I keep exploring?
 

Guest selects a storyteller or wish to search more 

LIV (if guest select storyteller):Wonderful. We’ll do our best to make this encounter happen — a meaningful moment to meet, learn, and create together.
Shall I send a request or do you need any further help?
(and now the basic essential questions about amount, private/corporate, when, budget, etc?
 
Booking saved to CMS. 

Press: 

What Media Says About Us (in one line)
Contact

Skip these two buttons because here it must be a focus on only contact details (LIV chat is everywhere else all over the webpage)
Design My Journey (FIT travelers).
Plan Our Experience (Corporate & Incentives).

Make the distance smaller between the title and text for contact and the fields to fill out, too much space between, now it looks like two different sections. It shall be one section for contact
Footer / end of the page

Background color is grey and text is white: not visible. Black/white version of text and background which the guest can choose. 

Correction / Adjustments:
We can skip Journey because they are the same as Experiences under explore. This is the correct listing:

Explore
Interactive Map
Experiences
Corporate & Incentives
Featured Storytellers
Design my Journey with LIV
