## Our Story
Who are we?
Luxury Travel Sweden was founded with one vision in 2021: to show the world a side of
Sweden that blends stunning nature, hidden gems, ultra-luxury service, and the people who
make this country extraordinary. We are not just a DMC; we are storytellers, curators, and
lifestyle creators.
Our Philosophy
Every journey is a narrative. We weave together nature, heritage, innovation, and lifestyle into
immersive stories that touch emotions and awaken curiosity. Luxury, for us, is not only
comfort — it’s access, intimacy, and meaning.
Why Us
• Over 20 years in the luxury travel industry.
• Local insiders with exclusive access and network
• A creative approach in creating experiences
• Ultra-luxury, white-glove service for seamless travel.
• Sustainability and authenticity at the heart of every journey.
Our Target group
Luxury Travel Sweden creates bespoke travel experiences tailored for discerning, open-
minded travelers who value authenticity and originality. We specialize in serving curious
cosmopolitans, decision-makers, innovators, and luxury seekers who want more than standard
tours, crowded attractions, or predictable itineraries. Our journeys are designed for those who
appreciate cultural storytelling, exclusive encounters, fine dining and wine, as well as
meaningful connections with like-minded people. If you’re looking for fresh perspectives,
unique experiences, and memorable adventures, you’ve found the right place with us.
Our Sustainability goal
Sweden leads the world in design, green technology, and social innovation — and so do we.
At Luxury Travel Sweden, we are committed to minimizing our environmental footprint
wherever possible, ensuring that our journeys are not only unique and memorable but also
respectful of the world we explore.

## Booking process
01. YOUR INPUT
We start with you—your preferences, personality, and travel history. From the cinematic
homepage, choose Explore (map), Design with LIV (our AI Luxury Itinerary Visionary), or
Enter the Experience. LIV drafts your trip around dates, group size, and interests (six themes:
Nature & Wellness, Design & Innovation, Culinary experiences, Nightlife & Celebration,
Royal, Art & Culture, Legacy & Meaningful Travel).
Send your AI-drafted enquiry, and a human curator takes over. Not sure where to begin? Let’s
brainstorm together.
02. RESEARCH & STORY DEVELOPMENT
Your human curator refines the draft with insider access, seasonal/logistical alignment, and
storyteller insights. They then present a first Story Proposal with activities, indicative pricing,
and sustainability elements.
03. CONFIRMATION & DETAILS
Once the story and costs are agreed, a deposit confirms your experience (“No money, no
honey” is our policy). We then:
• Implement the itinerary as soon as possible to secure your experiences
• Coordinate dietary needs, rooming, occasions, or corporate/legacy goals.
• Adjust the fine details as needed (with price updates before changes).
04. FINAL REVIEW & DEPARTURE
We reconfirm every detail—contacts, packing notes, seasonal tips, and support. Your curator
don´t leave anything to your destiny.
05. TRAVEL & FOLLOW UP
On trip, you’re in safe hands. For self-guided journeys, we check in and provide 24/7 support.
Afterward, we collect feedback, may share social media highlights (with permission), and
refine your profile and references so your next draft is even better.
