# Additional Files That May Need Rebranding

The following files also contain "LIV" and "Luxury Itinerary Visionary" references that may need to be updated:

## HTML Pages with Chat Overlays
1. ./our-story/index.html
2. ./storytellers/index.html
3. ./our-team/index.html
4. ./booking-process/index.html (also has reference in content text)
5. ./pricing-faq/index.html
6. ./our-services/index.html

## Specific References Found:

### booking-process/index.html
Contains this content text that references LIV:
"From the cinematic homepage, choose Explore (map), Design with LIV (our AI Luxury Itinerary Visionary), or Enter the Experience."

This should likely be updated to:
"From the cinematic homepage, choose Explore (map), Explore with Agent Henrik (our AI travel curator), or Enter the Experience."

## Recommendation
These files likely use the same chat overlay HTML structure and should be updated with the same changes made to index.html for consistency across the entire website.
